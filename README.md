I am testing a Git client developed under the ROOL bount scheme.
It is Beta, but so far I have not found any problems with it.

I have pushed old text down so that this README is acting as a blog with the latest 
stuff on top.

The text file demolocal mentioned below is being rewritten to reflect my experiences with the new client.

2021/../..

initially will hold a zip file containing a text file of presentation material used in the June MUG meeting
The zip has a text file demolocal meant to be viewed with StrongED using a tailored mode file JRlarge
which is included as a directory to be added to StrongED's modes.
